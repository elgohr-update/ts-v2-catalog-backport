# fruit

We don't know what kind of fruit this was. We only know that it grew on this tree. If possible it is best to use a general word for fruit here, and not a word for a specific kind of fruit.

# tree of the knowledge of good and evil

The woman correctly understood that they were not allowed to eat from this one tree that would enable them to understand evil as well as good.

# you will die

Use your ordinary word for death, for a person's physical life to end. Don't avoid the term just because the thought of death sounds too harsh.
