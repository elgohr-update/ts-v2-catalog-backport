# garden

A special collection of trees and plants that God prepared for Adam and Eve to enjoy and from which to eat. This should be the same word that was used in [01:11](01/11). See how you translated it there.

# talked with God

The word for "talk" should be the same as would be used to refer to talking to a human being. God may have taken a physical form to talk to the man and the woman since the text indicates that they talked to him face-to-face.

# shame

The feeling that comes with knowing we have sinned or that we fall short in some way.
