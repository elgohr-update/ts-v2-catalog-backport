# God said

God created light by means of a simple verbal command.

# let there be

This is a command that happened immediately because it was spoken by God. It may be more natural to translate this as a statement of certainty that this would definitely happen. For example, you could translate this as, "God said, 'There will be light.'"

# light

This was a special light that God createdâ€“the sun was not created until later.

# was good

This phrase is often repeated through the Creation story, and emphasizes that each stage of creation was pleasing to God and accomplished his plan and purpose.

# creation

This word is used here to refer to the six-day period during which God made everything that exists.
